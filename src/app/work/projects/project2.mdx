## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable design system using Next.js for front-end and Figma for design collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Media Monitoring**: Enables real-time tracking and analysis of brand mentions across global news outlets, social media, blogs, and forums.
- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis:**: Leverages natural language processing (NLP) to assess the sentiment of media content, providing actionable insights into public perception.
- **Customizable Data Visualizations**: Offers interactive dashboards and reports that allow users to analyze and visualize media data in a way that aligns with their specific business needs.
- **Seamless Integrations**: Integrates with major social media platforms and third-party tools, allowing users to consolidate data and gain a unified view of media coverage.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL, RESTful API, JWT
- **Database & APIs**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearc
- **Cloud & Deployment**: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx, Jenkins
- **AI & Chatbots**: ChatGPT, LangChain, Pinecone, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), OpenAI API

## Challenges and Learnings

I encountered challenges in optimizing real-time data processing for scalability, integrating diverse data sources, and maintaining fast, efficient user interfaces. Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience with tools like Apache Kafka and Redis for data handling, improved my ability to collaborate across teams, and strengthened my skills in cloud infrastructure, data visualization, and securing sensitive media data.

## Outcome

The project successfully enhanced the Meltwater platformâ€™s scalability, real-time data processing, and user experience, enabling more efficient media monitoring and analysis. The improvements in system performance and security contributed to a more robust and reliable platform, empowering users with actionable insights and seamless access to media data across multiple channels.
