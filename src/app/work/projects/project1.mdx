## Overview

Led the development of a high-performance, scalable web application by integrating full-stack technologies, automation, and modern UI/UX practices to enhance speed, reliability, and user satisfaction for enterprise-level data workflows.

## Key Features

- Re-engineered frontend systems with Next.js and Tailwind CSS to ensure pixel-perfect responsiveness, driving a 35% increase in user satisfaction across devices.
- Engineered backend services with Java, Python, and Django, supporting high-availability systems for enterprise clients.
- Spearheaded CI/CD automation using Docker and GitHub Actions, reducing release cycle time by 40% and ensuring consistent deployments across environments.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Cypress (for UI Testing)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Python, Django, Java
- **DevOps / Automation:**: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- \*Database & Version Control\*\*: MongoDB, Git, GitHub, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx

## Challenges and Learnings

Faced performance bottlenecks, deployment inconsistencies, and UI regressions while maintaining code quality in a fast-paced, data-heavy application environment.

## Outcome

Addressed these issues by implementing server-side optimizations, CI/CD automation, and frontend testing workflowsâ€”ensuring performance, reliability, and scalable team collaboration.
